### A bit about me

I am currently a last-semester MA student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Science (QMSS) program at Columbia University with undergraduate background in Mathematics and Statistics. Before graduate school, I have 6-years of experience working as a data and research analyst in both the public and private sectors in Indonesia :indonesia:

I enjoy doing research and exploring new statistical methods. I am always looking for opportunities to learn about varied quantitative methods to identify and possibly solve social science problems. My research topics of interest are education, inequality, and the labor force. I also helped create contents for [Ngobrolin Matematika](https://www.instagram.com/ngobrolmatematika/) (lit. Discussing Mathematics), an Instagram account that aims to help students in Indonesia to learn Mathematics in a fun and engaging way.
